# Lie-EQGNN
Lie-Equivariant Quantum Graph Neural Network

Discovering new phenomena, like the Higgs boson, involves the identification of rare signals that could shed light into unanswered questions about our universe. On the other hand, at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), large amounts of data are generated from particle collisions. This project aims to develop Lie-Equivariant Quantum Graph Neural Network (Lie-EQGNN), a quantum model that not only is data efficient, but also has symmetry-preserving properties from any arbitrary Lie algebra that can be learned directly from the data.
